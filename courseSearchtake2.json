To build an understanding of urban processes, students look at cities through a variety of lenses, namely experiential, historic, and political. The studio includes research, readings, and short-term and longer-term projects. The longer term project includes looking at a site within Baltimore City in collaboration with the Baltimore City Department of Planning.

Students study precedents in architectural drawing and communication, follow readings in theories of projective drawing and study representational strategies that use the power of architectural drawing to raise questions and to reveal the Architect's critical intent. In addition, students will execute a series of class drawing assignments, which will in some cases supplement Thesis design work conducted in AD410.",

We address not only the physical changes in the city itself, but also the literature, art, and film that were produced in dialogue with the fluctuating cityscape. Throughout the course, we investigate different definitions of modernity while studying the following historical topics: Ottoman and Orientalist photography, literature, and exhibitions; urbanism and public space as the showcase of the modern nation-state; filmic representations of social and political change in the city; and gentrification and Istanbul’s rise to the status of “global city” since the 2000s. In short, this course engages with the specific dynamics of Turkey’s cultural history, while also focusing on the transnational context of the world at large.",

This was a period during which the art world in China underwent substantial change, first adjusting to a state-organized system for the production of art after the Communist Party took control of the country and then acclimated to the international art scene after China opened up to the global economy in the 1980s. We will examine the political beliefs that shaped art in China from the founding of the PRC in 1949 to the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. We will then study the various ways Chinese artists have responded to (or resisted) the global art world since the 1980s.",

This course provides a survey of European manuscript production from the early medieval period through the late Gothic era, and touches on the early history of printed books. Students learn about the lavish miniatures found in deluxe manuscripts and examine the ornamental treatment of the text, including display script, illuminated initials, colored parchment, and marginalia. Manuscript illumination is discussed in the context of the owners, users, and purchasers of these objects. In addition, students learn about the techniques and materials used to make manuscripts and the binding of medieval books. Includes lectures, class discussions, and several trips to the Walters Art Museum to view manuscripts firsthand  Prerequisites: AH 201",

Key themes will include: the role of the desert and the frontier in the history of art; exploration and representation of the \"old west;\" the formation of hybrid modernisms and development of post modernism in the context of post-war urbanism, art making and migration; the formal and ethical possibilities of land, systems and site-specific work; the emergence of ecological and anti-nuclear consciousness; and contemporary challenges that take up these legacies.",

Before embarking on four case studies, students review working models of what constitutes avant-garde and modern practice in order to consider these regimes’ influence on the art, architecture, and film produced within the greater context of European modernism. Throughout the course (e.g., WPA programs), students analyze both the aestheticization of politics and the politicization of aesthetics. Lastly, the course includes a brief consideration of visual culture in the United States contemporary to the four European totalitarian regimes under investigation.",

Yet, from the outset, 9/11 unfolded as a uniquely visual phenomenon as well as one marked by its immediate social, political and historical effects.",

These “ah combines” are seminar-specific, multidimensional, and cumulative—each focusing on artists/critics documented since the 1960s whose writings, artworks, and working methods demonstrate specific principles appropriate for the aesthetic development of all. AH412 depicts contemporary art as an investigation into the nature of art, the metaphoric process, and the crucial involvement of the audience. Emphasis is on co-operative interactivity – creative collaboration as the catalyst for each student to construct an end-of-semester “curatorial exposition” representing significant issues in contemporary art. The course procedure aligns conceptually and practically with radical thinking in accordance with the work of Walter Benjamin, André Malraux, Harald Szeemann, Lucy Lippard, Harold Bloom, Dave Hickey, Susan Sontag, Azar Nafisi, Gilles Deleuze, Roland Barthes along with many other cultural critics/artists who have encouraged the individualization of our history of art to enhance the future of art.",

We address not only the physical changes in the city itself, but also the literature, art, and film that were produced in dialogue with the fluctuating cityscape. Throughout the course, we investigate different definitions of modernity while studying the following historical topics: Ottoman and Orientalist photography, literature, and exhibitions; urbanism and public space as the showcase of the modern nation-state; filmic representations of social and political change in the city; and gentrification and Istanbul’s rise to the status of “global city” since the 2000s. In short, this course engages with the specific dynamics of Turkey’s cultural history, while also focusing on the transnational context of the world at large.",

The class will start with very basic fundamentals of astrophysics and an overview of the phenomena chosen by the students. Those concepts will then be developed and translated into animation.   The last 5 weeks will be spent on animation and different ways of projections.  Students will be challenged to use their creative vision within a scientific constraint. Trip to NASA and to the Maryland Science Center will be part of the class.",

The fundamentals of 3D character modeling, rigging, and texturing to achieve believable movement are taught using 3DStudio Max by Autodesk. The concepts and techniques discussed throughout the course transcend the specifics of any software application. Students acquire 3D character theory and knowledge that can be deployed in any 3D character platform environment.",

Includes study of each of the major chemicals that make up clay bodies and glazes, creating a base knowledge of what these minerals do and how these materials behave. Introduces clay body formulation for a variety of approaches and effects.  Two 1.5 credits workshops in the 3D area will combine to fulfill a 3-credit studio elective.",

Includes study of each of the major chemicals that make up clay bodies and glazes, creating a base knowledge of what these minerals do and how these materials behave. Introduces clay body formulation for a variety of approaches and effects.  Two 1.5 credits workshops in the 3D area will combine to fulfill a 3-credit studio elective.",

Students would be asked to address themes of commodity, the aesthetics and craft of the factory, the mass-produced image and object. To this end, students would also address new problems and opportunities in ceramic material science and explore the material’s integration with digital fabrication. Students would work collaboratively, utilizing new technologies (in kiln technology and digital fabrication) and in the design of new tools and material approaches. This course would be about problem solving with a focus on process, research documentation and prototypes as the main by-product. Possible material research outcomes would include the development of new integrations of ceramics into digital fabrication processes, new uses for existing equipment (for example ceramic “extruders” to create architectural cladding systems), new approaches to materials, design ideation, object marketing and dissemination, firing technologies and many other approaches.",

Tapping opportunities afforded by the program to partner with arts, education and community organizations, they will consider urban public spaces as contexts and environments for presenting art, and explore alternative exhibition designs and education initiatives both within and outside of traditional venues. The proposal, a combination of writing, physical and digital models, sketches, site visits, videos, renderings, and/or maps, must document the student’s fieldwork, and demonstrate the ways the exhibit will connect with the interests, the goals and identity of the site and community in which it is placed.",

Apocalyptic, celebratory, sobering – the descriptions covered the gamut. From the point of view of the arts, the 20th century has been one of crisis aesthetics beginning with the explosive works of Cubism, Fauvism, Futurism, and ending with post-deconstruction, post-post-modernism and even celebrations of “bad art” (as hailed recently in the New York Times). Yet, a serious look at the various cultures of the century demonstrates that creativity, science, and technology are linked in an ongoing battle over representation and expression. This course focuses on the “permanent revolution” in the arts of the century in a multidisciplinary way, attempting to provide a framework for understanding both the destructive framework and the imaginative potential that emerged from some of the most rapacious and revealing works ever produced. As such it looks at the intertwined links between art, music, photography, and cinema in the light of literature, philosophy, and critical theory.   Graduate students only. Required for MA in Digital Arts students.",

We will focus on the fundamental elements of a variety of genres, learning from the examples of a spectrum of prose writers, poets and dramatists. In-class exercises and assignments will encourage us to experiment with character and scene development, narrative strategies, dialogue, point of view, autobiography, time and space, poetic compression, form, and the documentary practices of journalism. Our work will familiarize us with the many ways writers turn experience into expression and form into meaning. Visiting guest writers may offer observations of their respective crafts.  In addition to in-class exercises and workshop critiques of student work, assigned readings will develop awareness of historical contexts and innovations. Required for all LLC Creative Writing minors and for all intermediate and advanced writing workshops.",

In Cultural Relevance and Awareness assumptions about good design are contextualized from distinct cultural perspectives and the nature of “good design” is challenged. Students investigate principles of cultural variance, Universal Design, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), as well as inclusive approaches to design that focus on design consumers of various ages, abilities, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Rather than the promotion of design approaches that reflect cultural diversity via embellishment emphasis is on a more encompassing macro-level of design that is more holistic and inclusive.",

Quantitative and qualitative data, approaches to market research and marketing plans, informs the design process. Students test their design ideas against their marketing strategies and employ tools for analyzing their assumptions such as SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats ), COPE analysis, PEST analysis (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological), STEER analysis (Socio-cultural, Technological, Economic, Ecological, and Regulatory factors), and EPISTEL analysis (Environment, Political, Informatic, Social, Technological, Economic and Legal).",

What to omit and what to include to achieve a given effect? The purpose of this course is to provide a basic understanding of the human musculoskeletal system through a combination of lectures, labs, and directed studio assignments. The hope is that by better understanding human structure and motion students find their own answers to these questions. This is not a course in medical illustration, nor is it intended to be an academic approach to figure drawing.",

It covers issues as they emerge in practice: the need for disciplinary strategies, coping with limitations, understanding how to work within the educational community, developing creative teaching strategies, finding employment and completing applications, interviewing for positions, and securing recommendations. The course concludes with the Student Teacher Showcase in which students share the work their students have done under their instruction. Peers, department faculty, cooperating teachers, friends and families, and area supervisors are invited to attend.   Requires approval of the graduate director.",

Soft sculpture and inflatables have a rich history: from early inventions such as hot air balloons and zeppelins, to the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, to radical 1970s Antfarm structures, to sculptural works by contemporary artists. Students will learn multiple techniques for turning flexible, flat materials into three-dimensional forms by methods such as inflating with air, stuffing with materials, and holding with a rigid structure. Patterning will be explored extensively, including working from found patterns as well as designing and creating your own. Students will work at a range of scales - that which the body can hold and that which can hold the body. Studio work will be informed through experimentation, readings, slides, and in-depth exploration of context.",

        "ccdescrlong": "In this course, Baltimore is not a place but a process of self discovery -- a “finding” of sorts that provides students with the opportunity to think critically about their place in the world.  As a group, students will travel throughout the City; interact with a host of people from different walks of life; visit new, wonderful, and unusual places; and investigate the important issues and themes of the day.  Students will keep a visual diary of their ideas, opinions and feelings about these interactions and make artwork in a wide variety of media.  Students also have the opportunity to work with local elementary school children or senior citizens -- and produce small murals or other site specific artwork. This course emphasizes the importance of “being there,” present in the moment and fully cognizant of one’s own relationship to a real, living environment.  The vast majority of class sessions will be held “somewhere” in Baltimore.  Students will carpool.  Guest speakers and community artists will visit with students throughout the semester.",

Staff. Offered occasionally.  Examines the origins and development of horror cinema over the last century, with attention paid to a variety of periods including German Expressionism, American 50s horror, Gore, Japanese horror, and conceptual horror. The class looks at a variety of filmmakers from Murnau and Wiene to Warhol, Carpenter, and Nakata, to see how genre concerns are balanced with the director’s aesthetic prerogative. Students study films within cultural contexts to see how horror films are frequently a reflection of social concerns, and investigate the fine line between camp and genre excellence.

Aziz. Offered occasionally.  The course is aimed at re-evaluating the normative concepts and values regarding the body and its complex relationship with space as found in classic texts of modern architectural theory. Students will begin with a study and analysis of the OEsensory motor function¹ that informs the dynamics between body and space in Deleuze¹s theory of cinema. The critical terms from this investigation will then be used to examine the assumptions about the body & space in works of literature, art, film and architecture.\t3.00\t3.00\t.01\t2016-08-29 00:00:00.000\t2016-12-16 00:00:00.000\t1900-01-01 16:00:00.000\t1900-01-01 18:45:00.000\tN\tY\tN\tN\tN\tN\tN\tLEAKEHALL\tLeake Hall\tLeake Hall\tLH 101\tLH 101\tLH 101: Leake Hall Auditorium\tLH Auditor\tTimmy\tAziz\tSEM\t26\t26\n006588\t24579\tUGRD\t0416\tSpring 2017\tFilm and Media Studies (FLMM)\tFilm and Media Studies\tFLMM\t 355-TH\tReality, Illusion and the Moving Image\t3 credits. Staff. Offered occasionally.  Through extensive screenings, readings, and discussions, this course explores the continually shifting and elusive boundary between reality and illusion in film, video, installation, and animation; identifies the ways in which the moving image constructs fantasy or reveals its self-reflexive nature, using as a theoretical framework key texts and concepts from the fields of aesthetics, semiotics, and ethics. Explorations include the structural components that connote a space of “fantasy” or “verism” and a meditation on the social dynamic that generates or bridges the distances between self and other. Our examination will be expansive and generous, ranging from Hollywood classics like Singing in the Rain to the recent emergence of the indie mumblecore movement, to documentaries, to the new realm of YouTube, and to experimental video and film.

In 2011, MICA acquired many of Globe's assets — extensive wood type, photo and illustration cuts, hand-carved lettering, and sketches and posters. Using these materials, students will learn the craft of letterpress printing, from setting type to locking up forms to printing on the Vandercook proof presses in the studio.",

One of the earliest known paper cuttings is from China and dates back to 960 A.D.! Some areas explored will be papel picado (perforated paper), silhouettes, paper engineering, sculptural structures, installation, led lights, 3D book structures, pop ups, shadow puppets, 3 dimensional theaters, and collage.",

This course is an opportunity for students from majors to deepen their understanding of water and to apply their developing skills as artist to this subject. Through readings, film, guest lectures and field trips we will immerse ourselves in the science, history and esthetics of water.  This class will be an overview of how historical and contemporary artists have approached water as a subject in their work.  We will focus on our current relationship with water and how rapidly changing climate is resulting in a massive redistribution of this substance.  The impacts of drought, sea level rise, storm intensity and polar ice melt are rapidly becoming major factors shaping our lives. This is a multi-disciplinary class so students are welcome to develop projects according to their major snd field of study.",

There are many participants in this deeply complex situation. This course will be a living social practice forum where we will invite as many participants as possible to speak about their particular viewpoint. The goal will be to create a conversation that benefits everyone that is involved. Students enrolled in this course will be active organizers/documenters/communicators of this forum. As a class we will develop a visual and creative strategy to communicate the issues encountered. We will meet once per week for a 6 hr block. The second half of class will be a forum of invited guests moderated by students. The first half of the class will be class discussion and preparation. Some class days will be devoted entirely to class discussion on issues that we encounter and conversation on the role of art and design. This class will embrace as wide a spectrum from the North Avenue community as possible. Including but not limited to: Residents, Activists, community Organizers, Artists, Business Owners, Political Representatives, Baltimore City Police, Developers, Health Services ( particularly addiction counseling/ harm reduction)  Youth, Elderly, Faith Community, Nation of Islam, Job creation, Gang prevention …….",

This course will examine the history of the Crusades from both the perspective of the Crusaders and of those they attacked, particularly from Muslim and Arab sources.  The course will also attempt to contextualize the phenomenon of Crusading by providing an overview of Christian European and Arab Muslim culture and society, such as comparisons between Saint Augustine's theories of Just War and the idea of jihad in Islam.  Furthermore, we will look at the legacy and implications of the Crusades in the post-medieval world, including the continuation of the use of Crusading discourse in European/American imperialism and in anti-Western rhetoric in the present day.",

The opening of the B&O Railroad linked the vast agricultural areas of the Midwest to the Port of Baltimore and the Atlantic trade system. Baltimore lay at the heart of the industrial revolution. Architecture is perhaps the art form that most closely records the economic, demographic, and political record of a city. This is especially true of Baltimore’s architecture—its churches, factories, harbors, and neighborhoods. This class explores Baltimore’s history, using architecture as a roadmap of its development.

Current politicians invoke \"the American people”; pollsters and historians speak of a community's public opinion; medieval chronicles and modern newspapers alike describe scenes of mass hysteria, the dangerous rabble, and other similar manifestations of a sort of collective will. This class discusses the phenomenon of crowds, riots, and the mass and the various theories that have been developed to explain them. Topics include: theorizations of the crowd and the collective, mass hysteria and fear, demonstrations, sociological/mathematical modeling of crowd dynamics, the \"flash mob,\" and the relationship of the individual with mass society. Includes readings from Plato, Marx, Rousseau’s concept of the General Will, Freudian studies of the collective psychology such as Gustave Le Bon, Canetti, contemporary sociological studies, and Existentialist literature, as well as materials from other media such as the 1928 classic film The Crowd, supplemented by field studies of crowds in action and other activities.

        "ccdescrlong": "It is often said that totalitarian societies are characterized by propaganda and control of symbolic productions, while democratic societies maximize freedom of belief and expression. This class begins with the opposite assertion -- propaganda and thought control are, in fact, the cornerstone of democratic societies. In societies where governments and moneyed elites cannot easily use brute force to control people, they must adopt more subtle means of control, and in the 20th and 21st centuries this has been the control of thought through carefully designed spectacles and constructed meanings of contemporary events. This is not to say that force isn’t used in democratic societies, but an important part of the constructed meaning of “democracy” is that it is not used. While totalitarian societies control bodies, democratic societies control people’s minds. This is the lesson of George Orwell’s 1984. The contest over symbols and meanings in so-called “free or open societies” is therefore more crucial than it is in “closed societies.” Thus, as we will see in this class, public relations and propaganda have merged in the 20th century with news reporting and journalism so that now they are completely indistinguishable, or, to say it another way, most major journalism is in reality public relations. One of the founders of public relations, Edward Bernays, wrote that, “The engineering of consent is the very essence of the democratic process.”",

We will focus our energy in particular on art and cultural criticism, taking as our subjects of inquiry selected works of visual art, film, literature, and performance, as well as certain cultural phenomena.  As we read the work of influential critics and write our own essays, we will consider the purpose, value, and potential of criticism, and strive to develop our own unique critical voices.",

        "ccdescrlong": "An interdisciplinary course informed by history, intellectual history, the visual arts, anthropology, and literature. Observation of “exotic” peoples in order to gain knowledge of humankind is as old as Herodotus. But since the Western encounter with the New World and with non-Western cultures in the Early Modern period, the Western imagination has also turned the anthropological approach to purely artistic ends. This course examines actual travelers’ and explorers’ descriptions of “exotic” cultures, as well as fictional accounts and visual representations of these societies. It traces the development from amateur and ad hoc ethnography to the scientific observations written by modern anthropologists, and also considers the work of artists who have imagined societies that do not exist and who give us a “scientific” report on them. In some cases, it is difficult to distinguish the imaginary account from the true one. In all cases, however, the class discovers what the observer’s statements about the foreign society tell us about our own society. Readings include Herodotus, Captain Cook’s diaries, Melville, Michaux, Kafka, Levi-Strauss, Malinowski, Sahlins, and other works of art, fact, and fiction.  Prerequisite: HMST 101.",

The period known in European history as the Crusades (1095-1250) is actually the Arab world’s Golden Age of philosophy and literature. The great writers and libraries of the Muslim and Jewish Middle East (which included Spain) provided the intellectual material for the rise of Europe. After the Arabs came the empire of the Ottoman Turks. The class will conclude with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the late 1800s and the rise of the Islamic Resurgence or Nationalism in the mid-twentieth century.",

Our main emphasis will be on building a framework of major political, military, intellectual, and religious events and movements that have shaped world history from the Western perspective. As most people know, when Columbus set sail in 1492 he was not trying to find the Americas; rather he sought a sea shortcut into the vibrant Afro-Asiatic trading system and the center of the world’s wealth and culture at the time. But most people don’t know much about this world cultural center that extended for 1,000 years from the fall of Rome (ca. 400) to the rise of Europe (ca. 1500) and encompasses the land areas of Africa and Asia, a cultural and economic system centered on the Indian Ocean. This class proposes to explore the intellectual history of the Afro-Asiatic world system that attracted the interest of Europeans and gave them their intellectual and scientific foundations. It includes the empires of Mali and the Ottomans; the rise of Islam and the Islamic World; the Buddhist cultures in S.E. Asia and Japan.",

While in classical Greece man-boy love was considered a socio-economic privilege and tradition, in medieval Europe men and women were burned and hanged for what is now called homosexuality. This intellectual history of homosexuality surveys the period in the West from early Greece to the present and also includes a survey of homosexuality in Imperial China (500 BCE–1849 CE) and pre-Meiji Japan (800 BCE–1868 CE) The class also explores the conjunctions of this history with same-sex love in the visual arts and literature, from ancient Greece and Rome through the Christian Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the Baroque, the Pastoral Elegists, and the Gothic. The class continues with the birth of Modernism, the American Renaissance and Aestheticism, the Decadents, Realists, and Symbolists, the 19th century sexologists, the New Woman, Wilde, and the emerging “queer” culture.

The belief in witches was at this time pervasive and held at all levels of society from the lowest peasantry to elite society; this included high-ranking magistrates who took the threat of witchcraft to the security of the state very seriously, producing a number of learned treatises on how it might be effectively countered. The course will examine a variety of readings from the period, including treatises on witchcraft, inquisitor’s manuals, literary sources, and actual transcripts of witchcraft trials.

Versions of these myths entered the literary and in philosophical work of Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripedes, Herodotus, Plato, Pindar, and the lyric poets Ovid and Virgil.

The class follows a broadly chronological order and considers a wide array of theoretical texts deriving from and dealing with a range of modern historical matters of political violence—from state-sponsored violence and popular uprisings to mass extermination and anti-colonial revolutions. Major themes for discussion and debate include the distinction between political violence and warfare; the relationship between violence, national identity, and the rise of modern states; the causes and consequences of violence as a form of political contestation; the rise of the police as a modern institution of violence; the dynamic interaction of terrorism and torture in modern warfare; the correlation of various ideologies (based on religious communities and texts, scientific discourses on health and hygiene, and rhetoric of progress and enlightenment, etc.) to political violence; and alternatives to violence within political discourse. Most readings come from leading modern theorists of violence. Authors whose authority stems from a personal relationship to political violence (purveyor, victim, witness) are considered. The goal of the course is to provide the student with both a general background in the modern intellectual history of political violence, and a deep understanding of the problems and challenges political violence poses for the contemporary world.

The violent revolutions and uprisings of the 19th and 20th centuries base many of their revolutionary ideologies in the ideas of secularism that characterized the enlightenment and informed 19th and 20th century ideology. This course traces some of the dominant ideas and movements that defined and fed revolutionary fervor and culminated in revolutionary actions from the 18th century to the present, where revolution is characterized by fragmentation, competing schools of thought, and movements, and in some cases a return to a religious order. To understand what kinds of epistemologies (knowledge-forming ideas) dominated and influenced the worldview of the writers and thinkers, scientists, artists, and activists, students immerse themselves in the intellectual climate of the time. Students read primary texts that serve as a gateway into understanding ideas that shaped the knowledge of the writers of the time. This course is interdisciplinary and therefore looks beyond the ideas of revolutions, cultural revolutions, social movements, and the tenor of revolutionary ideas in de-colonizing nations in a variety of texts—ranging from literature, the arts, and philosophy to political and economic theory.

Now that the digital  divide is closing, open source concept testing is faster and has the  opportunity to circumvent the marketplace.  Now used in art and  manufacturing as well, this work model impacts culture, social  stratification, morality, politics, and conceptions of property.

Recent genetic research has revealed that humans are more than 99.9 percent identical and racial categories have no meaningful basis in biology. However, race remains a powerful idea in contemporary society, contributing to our personal identities and persistent inequalities. This course examines the history of the idea of race, beginning in the late Middle Ages when Europeans first encountered the diversity of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These initial encounters formed the basis for a “science” of race that emerged during the Enlightenment and reached its peak during the Victorian period, when the presumed superiority of white Europeans was used to justify the exploitation of non-white peoples. The course ends with a consideration of the experiences of those who were oppressed during the 19th century, as revealed in their memoirs.",

Students will learn how to breathe life into their characters though drawing from the model, studying the anatomy, and observing movement. These ideals will be reinforced by watching them in action through inspiring art presentations, animated films/shorts and video games.",

This course is designed to teach students to position themselves as journalists, and guide them in building their drawing practice in combination with writing, as a way to develop non-fiction narratives rooted in reportage and opinion. Students will be introduced to examples from visual journalism in historical and contemporary journalistic practices, that are sequential (comics, graphic novels, animation, zines, booklets)and non-sequential (political cartoons, editorial illustrations), and will be encouraged to experiment with these formats. The course will also introduce students to basic layout design and a functional understanding of production formats in order to equip them with the skills required to compile their narratives for print or web.",

Students are encouraged to develop new methods and sites to realize their ideas and concepts through material, process, form, and technology. Through rigorous critiques, students investigate their artistic intentions and how these are executed through the work to create meaning. The objective of this course is to guide students toward a thorough understanding and articulation of their work within larger cultural, theoretical, and historical contexts. Importance is also placed on developing skills to documenting these genres through photographs, video, and other techniques.  Prerequisite: FF 101 (Sculptural Forms)",

Consideration is given to aesthetic, political, and poetic concerns that are part of the creation of “place”. Students are encouraged to explore beyond traditional art exhibition sites in order to understand how the content of work cannot be separated from its context. Model making and drawing are used as tools in the development of ideas and processes before full-scale work is created. Students need to be highly motivated and use their initiative in order to work in this context where focus is on creating a spatial experience rather than an individual object.

The primary direction of the research is determined by the faculty leading the course, and varies each semester. Though this differs from the sort of autonomy typically afforded to students in a studio course, students are empowered as collaborators on a larger research project. Elements of the research are assigned to students individually or in small groups, aligned with the project goals and the students’ particular interests. Students work closely with the faculty leader to build a foundational understanding of the research area, determine research objectives, execute research, document process, integrate findings, and apply this new knowledge. Though closely supported by the faculty leader, students are expected to exercise agency, informed decision-making, and a personal commitment to the collaborative research project.

In every class, students will share their work in progress and will help each other find approaches or solutions to their specific challenges and issues. We will analyze films with screenplays that effectively play with the form to create lasting, thought-provoking and affecting stories. Through in-class critiques, group discussions and one-on- one sessions, students will apply new tools and approaches to their own work as they undergo the process of designing, breaking down, outlining and writing a full step outline, a beat sheet and the first ten pages of a feature length screenplay. As the semester progresses, in-class analysis and debate on the strengths and challenges posed by the students' work will shape the thematic emphasis of each class. Writing Intensive.",

While works such as Robinson Crusoe, Treasure Island, and A Passage to India have been linked with the Imperialist project of empire, works like Jane Eyre and Orlando have only recently come under similar critical scrutiny. The female Colonial legacy —in which women have traditionally held a more precarious position with respect to nationbuilding— has perhaps been less charted because women were located on a continuum of simultaneous oppression and domination within empire-building. This course serves as an overview and introduction to Colonial texts by juxtaposing men’s and women’s Colonial writing to study how the writers represented (or omitted) Colonialism, and how the ideologies of Empire surface or are critiqued in their works. Students read and analyze the literature in its socio-political context and focus particularly on the contradictions and paradoxes of nation-building and gendered and racialized involvement in the projects of Colonialism.

Course work consists of readings, criticism, discussions, short written analytical responses, imitative poems, formal essays, and group presentations.

He was an innovator and inventor of a number of popular genres, and his work offers us valuable insight into philosophy and psychology. Beyond this, he had a huge impact on literary and cultural history. His writing was central to the development of Symbolist poetry, modernist painting and illustration, film, psychoanalysis, and literary theory.    In this course we focus mainly on Poe’s works of what he described as the “Grotesque and the Arabesque,” including his Gothic tales of doubling and haunting, his tales of sensation, his philosophical speculations, and selected poems and criticism. We will also consider the work of his best-known illustrators, watch movies based on his works, and trace his legacy in Baltimore.",

Heated debates once surrounded which kinds of feminism more usefully counter the patriarchal structures we live with—the theory-laden French Feminism celebrating women as different, or the socially-oriented Anglo Feminism that strives for sameness with respect to the sexes. Today, a large body of feminist thought weds these schools—and yet the turf wars within feminism are as alive as ever. Moreover, the sex appeal of the French Feminist credo, “vive la différence,” and its joyful and playful attitude toward reclaiming and re-inventing patriarchal constructions, continue to seduce, fascinate, and appall women (and men). The class begins its exploration into French Feminism with the philosophical and very practical questions raised by Simone de Beauvoir; studies the possibilities of a feminine language or écriture féminine and comes to terms with the body as informing thought through Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Monique Wittig, and others; and engages in a rigorous critique of French Feminist issues as perhaps utopian, perhaps élitist, by non-academics and women of color. The readings are non-traditional and often hard to classify. They range from polemics to fiction, from philosophy to psychoanalysis, from the textual to the visual with a firm focus on what happens when women speak.

In the 20th century, humanity crossed a “certain threshold” according to Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz. “Things too atrocious to think of did not seem possible, but, beginning in 1914, they proved to be more and more possible. A discovery has been made, that civilizations are mortal.” Twentieth-century warfare claimed the lives of more than one hundred million people. In this course, students read the works of writers who suffered and survived the World Wars, the American War in Vietnam, and the wars of uprising and revolution in Latin America and Africa, including the “soldier poets” of the trenches, Ernest Hemingway, Mary Lee Settle, Marguerite Duras, Kurt Vonnegut, W. B. Sebald, Tim O’Brien, and others. The course concludes with works that address the implications of war in the 21st century.  Prerequisite: One 200-level course in literature.",

Drawing on the earlier discourses of confession, memoir and speculation, true crime first received attention as a form of literature with the publication of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood (1966), and has since diversified into a variety of other media, including documentary film, essay, and graphic novel. In this course, we will consider how these texts shed light on the process of justice and law enforcement (and their deficiencies), and investigate why stories of real-life murder and mystery strike such a deep chord in their audiences. Through the study of indicative texts and high-profile crimes from the 1950s to the present day, we will consider how our feelings about real-life crime can help us understand how a culture defines itself by its taboos and transgressors.",

Students examine the rise of aestheticism, symbolism, and art for art’s sake. The class reads literary works and also philosophy and history, including authors such as Byron, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Nietzsche, Huysmans, Wilde, Keats, and Dostoyevsky. In them, students see the collapse of European culture begun in the Renaissance and the beginnings of the dystopia of the 20th century.  Prerequisite: One 200-level course in literature",

We will exercise our ethical muscles by observation and analysis. The purpose of this course will be to grasp ideals and principles as they have been spelled out in a variety of traditional ethical systems and to apply these conceptual structures and guidelines to major problems and dilemmas of doing business and living in society.

Does the universe have meaning?  Is there life on other planets? What is the meaning of time and eternity?  Who are we and how did we get here?",

Students will explore the co-evolution of flowering plants and their pollinators, the idiosyncrasies of  many of these core species, and their ecosystem services; provisioning food, clean water, and recycled nutrients. The loss of these symbiotic species would alter the planet and severely compromise mankind's current lifestyle.   Animal behavior, botany,  physics, chemistry, climate change, agricultural practice, psychology, economics, and politics will be discussed. Students will be asked to research and present unusual topics to your class and be invited to observe and interact with a bee hive. Students will be challenged to present a poster at a scientific conference on pollinators.",

Students are encouraged to abandon preconceptions about art-making and their personal identity as artists.  Through readings, films and lectures, topics such as time, myth, and the body and its senses are introduced and provide an umbrella under which the student can roam in any direction.

The Play’s the Thing is a central requirement for MICA’s new interdisciplinary Theater Concentration.  Students selected for the cast and crew will become Spring 2014 members of The Rivals of the West, MICA’s theater company that stages ticketed dramatic performances for the public in BBOX each spring. The Play’s the Thing spring 2014 production is the smash Broadway and worldwide hit musical, The Little Shop of Horrors. The play will run for eight performances: April 3, 4, 5, 6 and April 10, 11, 12, 13.    The Little Shop of Horrors requires a cast of 10 (women and men) and an extensive technical crew, including stage managers; assistant directors; assistant producers; set, lighting and sound designers, technicians and fabricators; costumer designers and fabricators; prop designers and fabricators; makeup artists; and publicists (designers and marketers) among others. The Little Shop of Horrors presents a particularly exciting challenge for students in the design and fabrication of “Audrey Two” a giant, animated woman- and man-eating plant.     Auditions and the application/interview process will take place this fall on November 12, 13 and 14, 10 p.m.-12 a.m., in Falvey Hall in the Brown Center.

Discussion topics focus on camera operation, file formats, the impact of digital technology on contemporary photographic practice, as well as the aesthetic and ethical issues surrounding it. Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and other software applications are used to explore creative and experimental possibilities for processing and manipulating photographs. Studio work emphasizes printed, still imagery, but students are encouraged to devise new uses for their digital materials. Introduction to input and output peripherals will include digital cameras, scanners, and printers.",

        "ccdescrlong": "This is a course in the philosophy of language and interpretation (hermeneutics). We examine what it is to understand a language, and then go on to address fundamental problems in the understanding of oneself, others, and beings who are  “wholly other” like gods, or devils as the case may be.  Some of the questions addressed in the seminar are: Does the fact that we speak a particular language (that we are situated in a specific culture at a certain time) preclude us from understanding persons who express themselves in a different language, persons with “conceptual schemes” that seem radically different from ours? How does a community based upon an authoritative text, like the Bible or the U.S. Constitution, handle unbridgeable conflicts in interpretation?  Why would a god speak to human beings in figures, in a concealed or riddling manner? And how are we to understand such veiled language?  Are there certain times when we must be unintelligible to others and even to ourselves?  Are there conditions of our humanity which by their nature resist understanding?  The thinkers we read include: Heidegger, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Saint Augustine, Montaigne, Kierkegaard, Gadamer, Sartre, Davidson, Wittgenstein, Simmel, MacIntyre,  Rorty, Levi-Strauss, Freud, Fricker, Nagel, and Justices of the Supreme Court.  Literature includes selections from: Bible, Talmud, Shakespeare, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Tolstoy, Kafka, Proust, Handke, Delillo, Whitman, Dickinson, Celan.",

We explore how different concepts of the sublime spur the poetry of Blake, Dickinson, Crane, and Stevens as well as the “ethical sublime” in post-World War II artists and thinkers such as Celan, Levinas, Rothko, and Anselm Kiefer. We also consult continental and analytic philosophers for light on the problem.",

Multiple color solutions of images will be developed that can stand in support of, and lend clarity and direction to the work you are doing with painting, drawing, sculpture, and painterly approaches expressive of any major. The history of the relationship between painting and printmaking will be investigated as well various artists, both historical and contemporary, that employ painterly expression within the print medium. Demonstrations of a variety of print media and techniques are introduced for you to choose from to build painterly content through your own theme related body of print based work.

Investigating painting as both an illusionistic window and a manipulated object/surface, students will make works that challenge the binaries of fine art and decoration.  Through slides and discussion, we will trace the various threads of an expansive history that includes Lascaux cave painting, Etruscan tomb painting, the Arts and Crafts movement of the 19th century, and the Pattern & Decoration movement in the 20th century.  Sourcing from these entangled histories, we will look closely at how contemporary artists are collapsing together historically distinct methods.  Individually directed student projects will develop both two-and three-dimensional approaches to building surface and form, including digital methods and the relationship between the hand and the machine, exploring the value and meaning of artistic labor.  Throughout the course, students are encouraged to expand the concept of what constitutes a painting through multi-discipline investigation, what alternative surfaces for painting exist and how painting language can be applied to large-scale and installation work.",

We see this in the books we read, the music we listen to, the films we watch, those things that we continually look at in paintings when we go to museums. We choose the items that we have in our studios and, in turn, they define us as artists. They play a key role in our painting. We will work on finding this direction, this interest, this passion that for each one of us is different. We will paint in class, and we will discuss these ideas within individual and group critiques.",

Students explore materials and techniques used in painting from the 13th century to the present, including egg tempera with gilding, specific applications of oil, and various synthetic media. Students prepare surfaces and make paint and mediums using historic materials and sources in the reconstruction of masterworks, and in the application of historic methods to original compositions. Individual projects may include encaustic or fresco. The basic principles of art conservation are introduced, and trips include a visit to the National Gallery conservation studio. Many topics covered are applicable to disciplines other than painting.",

Readings include, among others, students read the Upanishads and the Bhagavad-Gita, the Buddha’s Sermons and biography, Confucius’ Analects, and the Tao te Ching. The class examines the centuries-long discussion between these thinkers regarding such fundamental philosophical topics as the structure of reality, the nature of the human self, the religious issues of destiny of the soul and the existence and nature of God, and the moral and political concerns of human social duties and proper techniques of ruling. In surveying this long exchange of ideas, students consider the historical forces that shaped and prompted these ideas, and the historical influences that they in turn imparted.

The course  encourages students to think creatively about religion and to challenge  themselves to think critically as well as self-reflectively about their  own culture. Is consumerism a way of life? What does consumerism reveal  about Western culture and its core values?",

Workshops, lectures, online learning modules, and other programming establish the background and supporting skills required for the theme of that semester’s class. With this foundation, students pursue research regarding the development of new digital fabrication processes (hardware/software/materials) or creative applications of existing technologies. Projects will often be advanced through interdisciplinary collaborative teams, and students will work across departments at MICA and often with others outside of the school. Learning and implementing effective methodologies, protocols, and tools for collaborative research will be a significant aspect of the course. Student will develop and maintain a process portfolio that will serve as an effective support for “publishing” this research, which may take a variety of forms. Themes for the class will vary each semester and will include topics such as 3D printer development, experimental robotic fabrication, parametric weaving, material exploration and development, biomimetics, biofabrication, algorithmic fabrication, experimental 3D input methods, or open research.",

After a brief introduction to the science of mind that includes the thoughts of ancient and 17th and 18th century philosophers, we will focus on the modern history of psychology as seen though its major systems or schools of thought, such as functionalism, structuralism, behaviorism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt, and existentialism. We will examine the changing attitudes about the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness in the United States as well as look at the depiction of psychology in modern cultural artifacts (including print and screen). We will look at the future of psychology in terms of the focus today on the brain as the origin of mental disorder and drugs as the cure for almost every psychological ill.",

        "ccdescrlong": "This course is an introduction to Native American studies with a particular focus on Native American religion. Like other indigenous religions around the world, Native American religions permeate the entire way of life, and their cultural expressions are enormously rich and creative. Native American religion expands usual definitions of world’s great religions by including relationships to land and spiritual dimensions of the material world. The land has religious meaning, and the natural environment is ultimately sacred. Readings focus on Mesoamerican, Lakota (Sioux) and Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) traditions. Students will explore Native American cosmovisions, creation stories, giving thanks prayers, vision quests, and ceremonial culture. Readings, films, and discussions address such critical issues as colonization and its consequences for Native Americans, sovereignty, freedom of religion, land rights, responses to climate change and globalization. The course invites students to reflect upon the contentious history of inter-cultural contact between indigenous and immigrant people of the Americas.",

        "ccdescrlong": "Since the fall of the Communist regimes 20 years ago, it has been taken for granted in the West that the Capitalist economic system is the best possible economic system, indeed, the best by nature, and our destiny as a species. This was of course not always the preponderant view. For most of its history, Capitalism was not supreme, and its supremacy self-evident, but rather, it knew significant competition—and in many parts of the world, still does. In light of the recent—and devastating—credit crisis that rocked the global economy in 2008, Capitalism’s nature, and its self-evident supremacy, very much came into question. Perhaps, critics wondered, it’s time to reconsider our embrace of bare-knuckled Capitalism in the West; perhaps it is time to consider subtler variations, compromises, hybrids—and evaluate the strengths and drawbacks of the Capitalist system anew. Perhaps it is time to admit what kind of Capitalist economy we have cobbled together—its essential problem might be that it is not in fact very ‘Capitalist’ at all! Imagine that. In this course, we will look at some of the most prominent writings in the ‘canon of Capitalism,’ as well as important contemporary voices critiquing the nature and character of the Capitalist system, and how we have allowed it to develop today.",

The emotions are a tantalizing subject for examination because they appear to tell us about our true selves. Yet anthropologists suggest that the emotions are neither individual nor universal. In this course we consider a broad sweep of emotions: fear, disgust, paranoia, pride, envy, compassion, and desire, examining how they vary across the world. Why, for example, don’t Inuit people show anger? How can we explain the British \"stiff upper-lip\"? And does it feel the same to fall in love if you do it in Baltimore or Bali? We also consider the political economy of the emotions: when lives are dominated by hunger, what becomes of love? When assaulted by daily acts of violence, what happens to trust?",
